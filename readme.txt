In order to run this simply open index.html.

Explanation.

The script creates two random numbers

1. Array Length - arrLength (1-100)
2. Chunk Length - chunk(1-10)

A new array is generated based on the arrLength

The new array is then split into Chunks and the result is logged to the console.

I am using an IIFE for execution
